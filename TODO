o include higher dimension with constants computed using rrcov:::.csolve.bw.S(bdp, p).
  Note: the highest dimension for .csolve.bw.S is only around 300-400.

o Create a separate document expaining the condition number restriction in the subsampling procedure of EMVE.

o Convert CovEM and emve function to Rcpp based.
